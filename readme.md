# learning

everything computer related that i'm trying to learn should be saved here

the idea is that there will be a collection of tasks written in the wiki of this repo that can be used to learn different languages such as assembly, c, rust etc...

key things to stick to:
    - directories will use hyphens
    - file names will use underscores
    - just be consistent
